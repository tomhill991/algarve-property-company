            <p><span class="first-character sc">W</span>e are a British owned family business operating in the Algarve, Portugal. We have been living and working here for over 15 years. The Algarve is one of the best places in the world to own property. There are tax advantages for people with pensions, visa schemes for non-European Citizens, property prices and cost of living are inexpensive and the weather is excellent. We understand the difficulties of purchasing a property from a distance. It's easy to waste time and money on flights and hotels etc. It can also be difficult finding reliable professionals eg. estate agents, solicitors, accountants, rental companies.
